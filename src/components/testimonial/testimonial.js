      "Describing my best friend's personality is somehow hard for me, because she is the most polite girl I have ever seen. She is so patient at all and solves her problems with her self.She prefers to be an independent woman who does not need anyone. I am so glad to have a friend like Tabasum.",

      "Ù‘I really like Tabasum's personality. She has alot of perfect points such as helping others in any situation. One thing that I honestly don't like about her is that she is kind of Introverted person opposite of me, however it can be a strength for her in her life. Lucky to have you dear.",
